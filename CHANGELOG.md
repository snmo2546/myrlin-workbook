# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **Session name in terminal pane titles** - Discovered sessions opened via drag-and-drop or context menu now show the custom renamed title instead of the raw Claude session UUID. Falls back to UUID when no custom name exists (PR #37 by @snmo2546)

## [0.9.7] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Home directory expansion** - Session working directories now support `~/path` syntax on all platforms. The `~` is expanded to the user's home directory at session creation time (PR #36 by @inorixu)
- **CJK path support** - Projects with Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters in their paths are now discovered and displayed correctly. Falls back to reading the original path from JSONL session data when UTF-8 decoding fails (PR #36 by @inorixu)

## [0.9.6] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **Duplicate terminal panes on restart** - Saved pane layouts were restored twice due to an unwaited async race condition. `loadTerminalLayout()` fired without being awaited, so pane restoration raced against subsequent initialization. The second restore found the target slots occupied and spilled into empty slots, doubling the pane count. Fixed by awaiting layout load before continuing init, and adding slot-occupied guards in both restore paths (fixes #35)

## [0.9.5] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **Cost request spam on page load** - Session costs were fetched with individual HTTP requests per session (N+1 pattern), causing 20+ requests on every page load and tab switch. Replaced with a single batch endpoint `GET /api/cost/batch` that returns all session costs in one response. Sidebar only re-renders when cost values actually change, eliminating the render loop.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Double paste in terminal** - Pasted text was sent twice via WebSocket because both the custom Ctrl+V handler and xterm.js native paste processing fired. Now blocks xterm.js native `insertFromPaste` events since we handle paste manually with bracketed paste sequences (PR #34 by @benoitmidon)

## [0.9.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Header logo broken on npx install** - Header referenced `logo-cropped.png` which was excluded from the npm package. Changed to `logo.png` for consistency with the login page (fixes #33, reported by @dianshu)

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Cost dashboard period totals** - "Last 24 hours", "Last 7 days", and "Last month" were counting the entire lifetime cost of any session active within the window, instead of only the cost incurred during that period. Now apportions cost per message using timestamps, so each period reflects only the spending that actually happened within it.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **One-time startup token** - Auto-login URL now uses a single-use, 60-second token instead of the plaintext password. Token is consumed on first use and cannot be replayed. The actual password never appears in URLs, terminal scrollback, or process listings (PR #28 by @dianshu)
- **Model aliases** - All model pickers now use official Claude Code aliases (opus, sonnet, haiku, sonnet[1m], opusplan) that auto-resolve to the latest version. Added Sonnet 1M and OpusPlan options (PR #31 by @croakingtoad)

### Fixed

- **Shell glob expansion bug** - `sonnet[1m]` was being mangled by bash before reaching Claude. Model values are now single-quoted in PTY commands (PR #31 by @croakingtoad)
- **Terminal "undefined" prefix** - Write buffers initialized in constructor to prevent "undefinedConnecting to session..." on first mount (PR #31 by @croakingtoad)
- **Missing crash-logger** - `src/crash-logger.js` was never committed, causing MODULE_NOT_FOUND in uncaught exception handlers (fixes #32, reported by @croakingtoad)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **AI-powered session finder** - "Find a Session" now uses Claude Haiku to semantically match natural language descriptions against all your projects and sessions. Describe what you're looking for ("that React auth project from last week") and get ranked results with AI-generated explanations of why each matches. Results appear as rich cards with confidence scores, project path, last active time, and session count. Click any card to open it in a terminal pane; results stay on screen so you can open multiple sessions. Falls back to keyword matching when no API key is configured.
- **Anthropic API key setting** - New "AI" category in Settings for configuring your Anthropic API key (used by the session finder). Key is stored server-side and displayed masked.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **Launcher "workspaceId is required" error** - Fixed session creation from the Launcher failing when the selected project had no existing sessions. The Launcher now matches workspaces by name as a fallback, and auto-creates a new workspace if no match is found (fixes #30, reported by @falceso)

## [0.8.9] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Hidden items management** - Hide projects, categories, and sessions from the sidebar via right-click context menu. Manage all hidden items in Settings > Hidden Items with one-click unhide or "Unhide All". Hidden items shown with dimmed opacity when "Show hidden" is toggled.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Two-stage terminal pane expand** - Expand button on each terminal pane header cycles through: normal, grid-fill (stage 1), and full viewport (stage 2). Collapse button returns to normal. Escape key collapses expanded panes as lowest-priority action in the key cascade (PR #29 by @croakingtoad, with fixes)

### Fixed

- **Pane expand z-index collision** - Stage 2 z-index lowered from 1000 to 900 so overlay panels (session manager, conflict center, modals) remain accessible when a pane is expanded
- **Escape handler conflict** - Pane collapse moved from standalone listener into the main Escape cascade, preventing double-firing when overlays are open

### Improved

- **Smooth expand/collapse transitions** - 150ms ease transition on expand/collapse for visual consistency with the rest of the UI

## [0.8.7] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **Terminal input freeze** - Deferred store lastActive updates off the PTY data path with `setImmediate` to prevent synchronous JSON I/O from blocking WebSocket sends during active output
- **CPU waste on background terminals** - Activity detection regex (ANSI strip + tool matching) now skips unfocused terminal panes
- **Image upload unauthorized** - Upload handler referenced `this.authToken` instead of `this.state.token`, causing all image uploads to fail with 401

### Improved

- **Image drag-and-drop UX** - Terminal pane blurs and dims when dragging an image over it, with a labeled pill overlay ("Drop image to send to this session") so it's clear which session receives the file

### Added

- **Restart Session** - Right-click context menu option on terminals to kill and relaunch a session in-place (picks up MCP config changes, settings updates, etc.)

## [0.8.6] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **npx install failure** - `scripts/postinstall.js` was excluded from the npm package by `.npmignore`, causing `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on `npx myrlin-workbook`. Fixed by excluding only dev scripts instead of the entire `scripts/` directory (#27, reported by @dianshu)

## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **td task management integration** - Optional td binary integration for task tracking in the docs panel. Toggle in Settings, configure binary path. Includes issue detail modal and sidebar toggle (PR #26 by @croakingtoad)
- **Initial prompt and flags passthrough** - Worktree sessions now pass through initial prompt and CLI flags (e.g. `--verbose`, `--agent-teams`) to the PTY on first launch (PR #26)
- **Worktree task records** - Track worktree lifecycle (branch, path, status, tags) with dedicated API endpoints (PR #26)

### Fixed

- **createSession workspaceId** - Pass workspaceId inside the options object instead of as a separate argument (PR #22 by @croakingtoad)
- **--continue without history** - Skip `--continue` flag when the working directory has no prior Claude JSONL history (PR #23 by @croakingtoad)
- **Worktree branch collision** - Handle "branch already checked out" error during worktree creation by detecting and skipping (PR #24 by @croakingtoad)
- **Worktree path collision** - Skip `git worktree add` if path is already registered as a worktree (PR #26)
- **Worktree repo root resolution** - Resolve td repo dir to main repo root for git worktrees (PR #26)
- **Flag checkbox values** - Strip leading `--` from flag checkbox values to avoid double-dash when constructing CLI args (PR #26)

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **New project "+" button** - The dropdown menu was immediately closing due to an event-bubbling race condition. The document-level click handler dismissed the menu before it could render. Fixed by stopping propagation on the button click (#20)
- **Cross-process state sync** - Projects created in the TUI never appeared in the GUI because each process had its own in-memory state. Added mtime-based disk sync so the GUI re-reads state when another process modifies the file (#20)
- **Concurrent write safety** - Atomic write temp files now use PID-unique filenames to prevent collisions when TUI and GUI write simultaneously

### Added

- **Git concurrency pool** - Limits concurrent git child processes to 3, preventing resource exhaustion when polling many sessions
- **Express error middleware** - Catch-all error handler prevents unhandled route errors from crashing the server
- **Directory validation** - Git status endpoint validates directory exists before spawning git processes
- **Restart Session** - Terminal context menu now has a "Restart Session" option that kills and relaunches in-place

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Sidebar chevrons** - Project directory group arrows now correctly point right (collapsed) and down (expanded), matching the workspace accordion pattern
- **Accordion persistence** - Collapsed workspace accordions no longer randomly re-open on SSE re-renders. Collapse state is persisted to localStorage
- **New session resume bug** - Right-click "New Session Here" on project directories now starts a fresh Claude session instead of resuming the most recent one via `--continue`

### Changed

- **+ button dropdown** - The sidebar + button now offers both "New Project" and "New Category" options via a dropdown menu
- **Visual divider** - Added an "Uncategorized" divider between category groups and ungrouped projects in the sidebar
- **Removed workspace nesting** - Removed "Set Parent" and "Remove Parent" from the workspace context menu. Use Categories for grouping instead, which is simpler and less confusing

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Change Environment (shell switcher)** -- Right-click any terminal pane to switch the Claude session's shell environment. On Windows: CMD, PowerShell, PowerShell 7 (pwsh), and Git Bash (auto-detected). On macOS/Linux: Bash, Zsh, Fish. The current shell is indicated with a checkmark. Switching kills the PTY and relaunches in the same pane slot with the new shell. Shell preference persists across tab group switches and layout restores. All shell names validated against strict allowlists for security.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **6-pane terminal grid** -- Expanded from 4 to 6 terminal panes with smart CSS grid layouts. Pane count auto-adapts: 1x1, 2x1, 2+1span, 2x2, 3+2span, 3x2. New `MAX_PANES` constant replaces all hardcoded loop bounds. Slot colors extended with red and pink for panes 5-6.
- **Launch New Session button** -- Sidebar button opens a frecency-ranked project launcher modal. Shows Pinned/Recent/All sections, fuzzy search across project names and paths, pin persistence via localStorage, CLAUDE.md badges, session name input, and model selector. Creates sessions directly and opens them in a terminal pane.
- **Voice/mic input** -- Web Speech API integration for Chrome/Edge. Mic button on each terminal pane header starts speech recognition, shows live interim transcript overlay, and sends final transcript to the terminal WebSocket. Pulses red while listening. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Gracefully hidden on unsupported browsers.
- **Conflict detection** -- JSONL-based global conflict detection across all active sessions. Backend scans the last 50KB of each session's JSONL for `Write` and `Edit` tool_use blocks, identifies overlapping file modifications across sessions. Amber pill badges on terminal pane headers show conflict count. Toast notifications for new conflicts (deduplicated). Context menu "Conflicts (N)" item shows file details. 30-second backend cache, 60-second frontend polling.

### Fixed

- **Tab pane layout bleeding** -- Switching to a new empty tab group no longer shows the previous group's multi-pane grid layout. Added `updateTerminalGridLayout()` call after cache restore/fresh-connect to always reset grid for the new group's pane count.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Task Spinoff** -- Right-click any session and select "Spinoff Tasks" to AI-extract independent, actionable tasks from the session's conversation history. The AI analyzes the conversation (via `claude --print`) and returns structured task specs with title, description, relevant files, acceptance criteria, and suggested branch names. Review and edit tasks in a modal with select/deselect checkboxes, inline-editable titles and descriptions, file badges, and criteria lists. Batch-create as worktree tasks (immediate start or backlog). Each spinoff task gets the "spinoff" tag for tracking.
- **Backend endpoints**: `POST /api/sessions/:id/extract-tasks` (AI conversation analysis), `POST /api/sessions/:id/spinoff-context` (rich context package generation with file snippets, project structure, CLAUDE.md, and git history), `POST /api/sessions/:id/spinoff-batch` (batch worktree task creation with worktree init hooks).
- **Spinoff dialog CSS**: Animated loading dots, task cards with deselected state, editable inputs, file badges, acceptance criteria lists.
- **Cloudflare named tunnel integration** -- UI setup guide and configuration for persistent remote access via Cloudflare Tunnels.

### Fixed

- **Notification dot not clearing** -- Tab group notification dots now clear properly when clicking the tab. Root cause: trivial PTY output was re-triggering `terminal-idle` events after the user acknowledged them.
- **CJK composition duplicate input** -- Korean and other CJK IME input no longer duplicates the last composed character. Removed conflicting composition event handlers, letting xterm.js's built-in CompositionHelper own IME handling. (Thanks @ntopia)
- **Linux/macOS path decoding** -- `decodeClaudePath` now correctly resolves Linux/macOS encoded paths (e.g., `-home-vivi-pingterra` to `/home/vivi/pingterra`). Extracted shared `greedyFsWalk` helper. (Thanks @Vidalee)
- **Mobile terminal scroll snap-back** -- Touch scrolling no longer snaps back to the bottom on new PTY output. Switched from direct `scrollTop` manipulation to `term.scrollLines()` API to keep xterm.js internal state in sync. Time-based momentum decay for consistent feel across refresh rates. (Thanks @Vidalee)
- **Null session guard** -- PTY `attachClient` now guards against null sessions from `spawnSession`, preventing crashes on edge-case connection failures.

## [0.7.0-alpha.12] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Pull request automation** -- Create GitHub PRs directly from worktree tasks via `gh` CLI. PR creation modal with title, AI-generated description (via `claude --print`), base branch selector, labels, and draft toggle. PR badges on kanban cards link to GitHub with state coloring (green=open, grey=draft, mauve=merged, red=closed). "Create PR" button in review column, kanban context menu, and session detail banner. Auto-advances tasks to Done when PR is merged. "Refresh PR Status" and "View PR" actions for existing PRs.

## [0.7.0-alpha.11] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Cross-cutting tag system** -- Add comma-separated tags to tasks and sessions. Tags appear as color-coded badges (Catppuccin palette hash) on kanban cards and session list. Searchable via task filter. Edit tags via right-click context menu on kanban cards or sessions. Tags input in New Task dialog.
- **Multi-model orchestration** -- Change a task's model from the kanban card context menu. Configure default models for Planning and Running stages in Settings > Advanced. Tasks without a model auto-inherit the stage default when dragged between columns. Model dropdown options show cost/speed hints.
- **Agent teams UX** -- New Task dialog includes agent teams checkbox and collapsible "How agent workflows work" panel explaining single-agent vs model-per-stage vs agent teams tradeoffs. Kanban cards show stage progress dots (workflow progression indicator). Settings model dropdowns include descriptive hints.
- **Select-type settings** -- Settings renderer now supports dropdown select inputs in addition to toggles, numbers, and scales.

## [0.7.0-alpha.10] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Sidebar Projects/Tasks toggle** -- New toggle pill at the top of the sidebar switches between Projects (project/session tree) and Tasks (compact worktree task list). Tasks view shows running/review/backlog status dots. Click any task to jump to the kanban board.
- **Agent count badges on kanban cards** -- Running task cards now show a teal "N agents" badge when the session has active subagents, using the existing subagent detection cache.

## [0.7.0-alpha.9] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Planning kanban column** -- 5-column kanban board: Backlog | Planning | Running | Review | Done. The Planning column (mauve) is for exploration and design work before committing to active development.
- **Worktree init hooks** -- Configure `copy_files` (array of relative paths like CLAUDE.md, .env.example) and `init_script` (shell command) that run automatically when new worktree tasks are created. API: `GET/PUT /api/worktree-init-hooks`.

## [0.7.0-alpha.8] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Task dependencies** -- Right-click a kanban card to set "blocked by" relationships with other tasks. Blocked tasks show a red indicator and are visually dimmed. Dependencies are toggled individually or cleared in bulk.
- **Timeline audit trail** -- Every status transition (backlog -> running -> review -> done) is recorded with timestamp. Completed tasks show "N transitions -- Xh Ym total" duration on cards. Full timeline viewable via right-click context menu.
- **Concurrent task limits** -- New "Max Concurrent Tasks" setting (1-8, default 4) in Settings > Advanced. Enforced when starting new tasks and when dragging to the Running column.
- **Kanban card context menu** -- Right-click cards to manage dependencies, view timeline, or delete tasks.
- **Task backlog API** -- Server now supports `startNow: false` to create tasks without provisioning worktree or session, placed directly in backlog.

## [0.7.0-alpha.7] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Task search and filtering** -- Filter input in the tasks panel header filters cards by branch, description, model, or status across both board and list layouts.
- **"Open All in Tab" context menu** -- Right-click a project and select "Open All in Tab" to create a new tab group with up to 4 sessions from that project opened automatically.
- **GitHub-style kanban cards** -- Colored left border accent per status column (grey=backlog, green=running, amber=review, blue=done), subtle hover lift animation, and 2-degree rotation during drag.
- **Live session preview** -- Running task cards in the kanban board show the last line of terminal output in a monospace preview strip, updated on each board render.
- **Task backlog support** -- New Task dialog has "Start immediately" checkbox. Uncheck to create a task in the backlog column without provisioning a worktree or session. Start it later by dragging to Running.
- **Task description field** -- New Task dialog now includes an optional description field for additional context.

## [0.7.0-alpha.6] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Kanban board view** -- Worktree tasks now display in a horizontal kanban board with 4 columns: Backlog, Running, Review, Done. Cards are draggable between columns to change task status. Each card shows branch name, model badge, relative time, and change statistics. Column-specific action buttons (Open Terminal, Merge, Diff, Push).
- **Tasks layout toggle** -- Switch between board (kanban) and list view via toggle buttons in the tasks panel header. Preference persisted to localStorage. Board is the default.
- **CORS hostname security fix** -- Tightened the LAN/Tailscale CORS hostname check from PR #6 to use exact hostname comparison via URL parsing instead of substring matching, preventing bypass attacks like `192.168.1.100.evil.com`.

## [0.7.0-alpha.5] - 2026-02-21

### Changed

- **Organizational hierarchy renamed** -- "Workspace Groups" are now "Categories", "Workspaces" are now "Projects", child workspaces are "Focuses". The 3-level hierarchy is: Category > Project > Focus > Sessions. All user-visible UI labels updated across ~90 strings (toasts, modals, context menus, command palette, sidebar, cost dashboard, README).
- **"Discovered" section renamed** -- The auto-discovered sessions section (formerly "Projects") is now "Discovered" to avoid collision with the new "Projects" terminology.
- **README updated** -- New hierarchy diagram, terminology throughout, roadmap split into Coming Soon/Shipped, test count updated to 42.

### Added

- **3-pane grid layout fix** -- When 3 terminals are open, the bottom pane now spans both columns (no wasted empty quadrant). Uses CSS `grid-column: span 2` on the last filled pane.

## [0.7.0-alpha.4] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Mobile input row visible on desktop** -- The "Type here... / Send" input row from PR #6 had no base `display: none` rule, so it showed on desktop browsers. Now hidden by default in `styles.css`, only shown on mobile via `styles-mobile.css`.

## [0.7.0-alpha.3] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Tab group pane layout bleeding** -- Switching from a multi-pane tab group to a single-pane tab group and back no longer collapses all panes to one. Root cause: CSS `.terminal-pane { display: flex }` overrode the browser UA `[hidden] { display: none }` rule, making `paneEl.hidden = true` ineffective for hiding grid slots during tab switches. Added `.terminal-pane[hidden] { display: none !important; }` override and explicit `paneEl.hidden = false` in the restore-from-cache path.

### Added (merged from PR #6 by @jfrostad)

- **Mobile scrollbar hiding** -- Hides scrollbars on mobile to prevent layout interference.
- **Dedicated mobile input field** -- Touch-friendly input row with Send button replaces unreliable virtual keyboard interaction.
- **IME composition guard** -- Prevents partial input submission during autocorrect/IME composition.
- **xterm textarea attributes** -- Sets `autocomplete=off, autocorrect=off, autocapitalize=off, spellcheck=false` on xterm textareas.
- **LAN/Tailscale CORS** -- Dynamic CORS and CSP headers for local network access.

## [0.7.0-alpha.2] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Session item two-line layout** — Session names display on their own line with badges, size, and time on a second row underneath. Removes 22-character name truncation.
- **Auto-trust & question detection** — Automatically accepts safe trust/permission prompts (Y/n, trust folder, proceed, allow tool access) with 12 danger keyword guards (delete, credential, password, etc.). Amber "Needs input" badge on pane header for dangerous prompts. Opt-in via Settings > Automation.
- **Tri-state status dots** — Worktree task sessions show pulsing green (active), amber (idle/waiting), or blue checkmark (done with commits) in sidebar. Server enriches tasks with `branchAhead` and `changedFiles` counts.
- **Worktree Tasks view** — Dedicated "Tasks" sidebar view mode showing tasks grouped by Active/Review/Completed with quick actions (Open, Merge, Diff, Push).
- **New Task dialog** — Full-featured task creation with auto-detected project directories, live branch name preview, model selector, flag checkboxes, and initial prompt.
- **Workspace hover button** — Hover over a workspace to show a `+` button for quick worktree task creation.
- **Changed files API** — `GET /api/worktree-tasks/:id/changes` returns per-file additions, deletions, and status (A/M/D/R).
- **Per-file diff API** — `POST /api/worktree-tasks/:id/diff` now accepts optional `file` field for single-file diffs.
- **Diff viewer modal** — Full diff viewer with file list sidebar (status icons, +/- counts), syntax-highlighted unified diff, hunk headers, and line numbers.
- **Changed files in session detail** — Collapsible "Changed Files" section below worktree task review banner with click-to-open-diff.
- **One-click merge dialog** — Merge dialog with squash toggle, custom commit message, and push-to-remote option. Replaces simple confirm modal.
- **Branch push endpoint** — `POST /api/worktree-tasks/:id/push` pushes branch to remote for PR workflows. Push button in review banner and Tasks view.
- **Workflows documentation** — Comprehensive `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` covering all features with user stories and step-by-step guides.
- **16 new unit tests** — Auto-trust pattern matching (10 tests), diff parsing (4 tests), numstat parsing (2 tests). Total: 42 tests.

## [0.7.0-alpha.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Tab group switch blank canvas** — Switching from a 4-pane tab group to a 1-pane group and back caused all 4 terminals to appear blank. Canvas pixel buffer was cleared when xterm.js DOM was moved to DocumentFragments for caching. Added explicit `term.refresh()` after restoring cached panes.
- **Discover Sessions "Import Selected"** — Clicking "Import Selected" in the Discover Claude Sessions modal did nothing. The confirm button had no click handler wired to resolve the promise.
- **Dead terminal panes filling grid** — Saved layouts with stale sessions showed a multi-pane grid with dead terminals. Panes now auto-close after fatal connection errors (max retries or server error 1011).
- **Mobile terminal scrolling** — Swiping on the terminal body now scrolls with native-feeling momentum. Manual touch-scroll handler bypasses xterm.js's touch event interception that was blocking native scroll. Long-press (400ms) activates text selection without triggering keyboard. Scrollbar now visible and draggable on mobile.

### Added

- **Inspect Element** — Right-click anywhere shows "Inspect Element" and "Copy Selector" for developer access. Uses Chrome DevTools `inspect()` when available, falls back to console logging.
- **Organized context menus** — Session context menu items grouped into submenus (Naming, Insights, Advanced) to reduce clutter from ~18 flat items to ~12 grouped items.

### Removed

- **Weekly usage quota widget** — Fully removed (sidebar progress bars, polling, settings, API endpoint). Code archived to `docs/QUOTA_WIDGET_REFERENCE.md` for future re-implementation. Context window tracking in session detail and Resources panel retained.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Command Palette** — Ctrl+K now searches sessions, workspaces, features, actions, settings, and keyboard shortcuts. Type `>` for command mode (actions only), press `?` or `F1` for help mode (browse all features). Color-coded result badges per type (session/workspace/action/feature/setting/shortcut) with keyboard shortcut indicators.
- **Feature Discovery** — 30+ feature catalog entries covering every capability in the app. Users can search "worktree", "template", "cost", etc. to discover features they didn't know existed. Settings are also searchable from the palette.
- **Worktree Task Automation** — Create isolated worktree branches for Claude to work on autonomously. Right-click workspace > "New Worktree Task" (requires opt-in via Settings > Advanced). Auto-creates git worktree + branch + session. When session stops, task auto-transitions to "review" status with View Diff / Merge / Reject / Resume actions in the session detail panel. Merge cleans up the worktree and branch automatically.
- **Worktree Tasks API** — Full CRUD endpoints: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/worktree-tasks`, plus `/merge`, `/reject`, `/diff` action endpoints. SSE events for real-time updates.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Refocus Session** — right-click any session to distill the full conversation into a structured context document, then Reset (clear + reinject) or Compact (compress + reinject) the session. Gives Claude a fresh context window with full project awareness.
- **Unified Context Menus** — terminal pane right-click now includes all session management options (Start/Stop, Model, Flags, Rename, Summarize, Templates, Move to Workspace, etc.) matching the sidebar context menu.
- **Persistent Password Config** — password can now be set in `~/.myrlin/config.json` for automatic startup without prompts.
- **Cross-Platform Support** — merged community PR for WSL/Linux shell spawning. Shell selection, browser launch, and demo paths now work on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Security Hardening** — three-layer input validation (API boundary, WebSocket boundary, spawn point) for command injection prevention. Shell allowlist for safe binary selection. HTML escaping for template chip tooltips.

### Fixed

- **Terminal Scrollback Preserved on Tab Switch** — hidden terminal panes no longer get resized to 1x1 when switching tabs, which was permanently garbling scrollback. All 9 fit() call sites now use visibility-guarded `safeFit()`.
- **Mobile Terminal Scroll** — native compositor-thread scrolling for 60fps smooth mobile scrolling.
- **Session Rename Persistence** — renaming a session (via context menu, inline edit, or auto-title) now syncs the new name to terminal pane tabs, sidebar, and project views globally.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Login Logo Restored** - login page uses original full logo at 420px. Header and README use cleaned cropped logo (no black background). Separate image files for login vs header.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **5 New Themes** - Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night (dark), Rose Pine Dawn, Gruvbox Light (light). Now 13 themes total.
- **Theme Dropdown Sections** - Dark and Light categories with section headers. Official Catppuccin themes marked with star badge.
- **Cropped Logo** - updated app header and README with larger cropped logo (64px header, 250px README).

### Fixed

- **Project Discovery with Spaces** - directories with spaces in names (e.g. "Work AI Project") now correctly discovered. `decodeClaudePath()` tries space-joined candidates alongside hyphen-joined.
- **Marketing Scripts Removed from Repo** - internal scripts and strategy docs properly gitignored and untracked.

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Session Manager Overlay** - click running/total session counts in header to open a dropdown panel. Mass-select sessions, batch stop, filter (All/Running/Stopped), one-click terminal open. If session is already in a pane, activates it.
- **Conflict Center UI** - clickable warning badge in header shows conflicting file count. Click to open overlay with per-file breakdown showing which sessions edit each file. Click a session chip to jump to its terminal pane.
- **Tab Close Buttons** - X button on desktop tab group tabs. Confirmation dialog when live sessions exist; kills PTY sessions on confirm.
- **Drag-and-Hold Tab Grouping** - hold a tab over another for 1.2 seconds to auto-create a folder containing both tabs. Pulsing glow visual feedback. Joins existing folder if target is already grouped.
- **Costs Dashboard Tab** - replaced "All" tab with "Costs". Full cost dashboard with period selector (Day/Week/Month/All), summary cards, SVG timeline chart, model/workspace breakdown, sortable session table.
- **Workspace Group Improvements** - groups render at top, tinted backgrounds using `color-mix()`, larger headers, indented children with accent border.
- **4 Additional Themes** - expanded to 8 total Catppuccin flavors.

### Fixed

- **Terminal Flashing** - deduplicated `updatePaneActivity()` DOM writes; skips innerHTML when content unchanged.
- **Bracketed Paste** - pasted text now wrapped in ESC[200~/ESC[201~ so shells correctly handle special characters.
- **Cost Dashboard Accuracy** - raised JSONL file size limit from 10MB to 500MB; large sessions were silently skipped.
- **Terminal Session Restore** - `--continue` fallback when `resumeSessionId` is null; async UUID detection after PTY spawn.
- **Session `lastActive`** - now correctly updates on workspace refresh.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Visual QA MCP Server** (`src/mcp/visual-qa.js`) - gives Claude "eyes and hands" for web UI development via Chrome DevTools Protocol. 4 tools: `screenshot`, `query_dom`, `execute_js`, `list_targets`. Works with any browser or Electron app that exposes a CDP debugging port.
- **`--cdp` flag** for GUI launcher - `npm run gui:cdp` launches browser with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` so the Visual QA MCP can connect automatically.
- **`npm run mcp:visual-qa`** script to run the MCP server standalone.
- `chrome-remote-interface` dependency for lightweight CDP access (~50KB).
- Registered `visual-qa` MCP server globally in Claude Code settings.
- Added Visual QA workflow documentation to global CLAUDE.md for use across all web/UI projects.
